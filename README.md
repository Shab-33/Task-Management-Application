work organised and teams in sync. It allows project managers to assign tasks and track progress, 
while team members can see their tasks for the day and mark them off when done. Itâ€™s secure, easy 
to use, and keeps everyone's daily goals clear and manageable. The aim of this application is to make
work life smoother and more productive.
